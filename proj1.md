Campus Repeater Setup

set up repeater on campus so students w ham licenses can communicate with each other on campus and practice getting on the air more

part 1: 

first part was to solder the repeater's identification board together--a kit. easy ehough, took about 4 hours. i realized part through that my soldering iron stopped heating midway so i was waiting a while for the solder to melt. goes to show that you should always check if your tools are working.
